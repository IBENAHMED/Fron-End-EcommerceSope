                    An e-commerce website is an online platform that facilitates
                    the buying and selling of products or services over the internet.
                    It serves as a virtual marketplace where businesses and individuals
                    showcase their products, interact with customers, and conduct
                    transactions without the need for a physical presence. E-commerce
                    websites have gained immense popularity due to their convenience,
                    accessibility, and the global reach they offer.
